# select solver type
#the options are
# LDU - standard LDU solver
# LDUbalanced  - standard LDU solver with row balancing algorithm
# PCGdiag -- preconditioned conjugate gradient with diagonal scaling
# PCGbalanced --  preconditioned conjugate gradient with row balancing algorithm
# BJLDU -- block Jacobi with LDU, use only for coupled problems otherwise an error in inputs will be reported
# LDUdefault - standard LDU solver, no reordering
#LDUPCG -- use just for ADE+RE, RE is solved by LDU, ADE by PCG -- very experimental, use only if you know what you are doing

LDU 

#record solver time [y/n] if yes, then time for solving the system of linear equations is recorded into out/solver.time
